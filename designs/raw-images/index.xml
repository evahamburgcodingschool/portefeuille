      <description>The final project of the Full Stack Web Development Program at Hamburg Coding School was also a travel blog but in React. I scored 15/15 points.
I could have built up on the previous blog, but decided to work from scratch. Only images and places made it from the first travel blog to the second.
The homepage is devided into a map with markers on one side and a collection of all preview cards of places I have visted on the other.</description>

      <description>The first project of my Full Stack Web Development Program at Hamburg Coding School was a travel blog using JavaScript, Google Maps and Firebase.
The homepage is a map with markers on the geographic locations of places I have visted. At clicking a marker, a card with an image and a short description appears. The data on the cards is loaded from Firebase Database, while the images are stored locally. A login page performed through Firebase Authentication allows a user to see the collection of all blog posts, edit, and add new posts.</description>
